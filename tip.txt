s
flags: - : left align
min-width: is the total width, if width is smaller than min width, its filled with empty spaces
precision: if it is zero or less it is ignored, if it's bigger than the string it's ignored
2nd flags: ignore all

c
flags: - : left align
min-width: is the total width, if width is smaller than min width, its filled with empty spaces
precision: ignored
2nd flags: l : 'wint_t'

p
flags: - : left align
min-width: is the total width, if width is smaller than min width, its filled with empty spaces
precision: ignored
2nd flags: ignored

d/i - signed decimal/integer
flags: Prepended +, - and ' ' count towards the min width
'-' : left-align
'+' : prepends '+' or '-'
' ' : prepends ' ' or '-'
- IGNORED: when flag '+' is present
'0' : fills width with 0's, if there is a plus or minus sign it comes before the zeros
CHECK: width option, prepended vals before 0's
- IGNORED: when flag '-' is present
- CHECK!!! if precision is present only fills zeros to the limit of precision
so if num is 6 chars and precision is 7 and min width is 10 it will add 1 0 and 3 empty spaces
min-width: is the total width, if width is smaller than min width, its filled with empty spaces
precision: if precision is smaller than the length of the number it is ignored, but if it is bigger it is filled with 0's
2nd flags: ll : long long, l : long, hh: char, h : short

'#' : 0 is prepended to non-zero numbers.
CHECK: val is not zero
IMPORTANT: 0 counts towards min-width, but not precision and is prepended
